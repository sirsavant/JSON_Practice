/*

JSON - a text-based data format file which has the same syntax compared to javascript objects where data is stored in property-value pairs and arrays. It is mainly used to transfer data in web applications. JSON exists as a string and when you need to use JSON, you need to deserialize it to use it in your program. When you need to convert it back to a string, you serialize it. JavaScript has a global object called JSON that provides methods for you to modify JSON.
